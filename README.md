##ChocolateChip-UI - Red

This is a custom red version of the themes used by ChocolateChip-UI. You can use it as the basis of your own custom color theme. It only includes the LESS files. Just put them in the same directory as the other LESS files in your local repository, then run `grunt themes` to build out the CSS files.

It's easy to change this theme to use your own color. Just open the file "colors.less" for each theme. Then change the hex value for the color of the definition @appTint to the color you want. Runt `grunt themes` in the terminal and you have a new color theme.


Please visit [ChocolateChip-UI's Website](http://chocolatechip-ui.com) for documentation and tutorials. This project includes examples for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 to help you get going.
